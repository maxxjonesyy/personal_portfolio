My personal portfolio page, i wanted to try out SASS on this project as I've only heard great things, it was to no surprise fantastic and i will continue to use it on most, if not all of my future projects. The Website features a simple yet clean layout designed by myself which I believe showcases my work nicely without being too over the top.


Technologies
---
HTML, CSS, Javascript and SASS

If you take the time to have a read through the code and have some constructive criticism feel free to send it my way!

Some snaps of the Website, a link to the hosted site is in the description.
